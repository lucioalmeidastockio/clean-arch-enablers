# :coffee: clean-arch-enablers
This lib is meant to make implementing apps with clean arch easier. :pinched_fingers:
<br>

## :thinking: - Why?
:face_with_head_bandage: Implementing clean architectured systems might require the construction of many components from scratch only for providing a foundation which the actual application will be developed upon. This consumes time and effort, a lot. 

:bulb: Turns out all the boilerplate code is very repetitive when you reach a matured architecture of components (use cases, ports and so on). So it would be nice to be able to just abstract it away into a layer with all the boilerplate only once and then just reuse it whenever it'd be needed, on any project.
